# Crystal Clear Recruitment

**Crystal Clear Recruitment** is an online platform designed to connect job seekers with potential employers. The website offers real-time updates on job applications, allowing job seekers to search for opportunities, access interview tips, and learn more about the recruitment process.

For admins, the platform provides tools to review applications, manage job seeker profiles, and respond to applications with 'approve', 'decline', or leave them 'pending'. Job seekers can also update their profiles with the latest information, including their interests, profile picture, and an up-to-date CV, making the application process seamless and efficient.

## Testing:

Performed comprehensive **moq** and **Xunit** tests that validate crucial features such as business logic, user accessibility, scalability, security, and overall functionality to ensure the application runs seamlessly.

## Deployment:

Crystal Clear Recruitment is hosted on **Azure**. I initially created a local database using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for development/cost purposes. Once the application was ready for deployment, I set up an **Azure SQL Server** and **Azure SQL Database**. I then updated the connection strings and modified the migrations to ensure that my new database was populated with the necessary tables. Finally, after ensuring the database connection was properly configured, I published the application using **Visual Studio**.

## Design Comments:

I utilised resources from **W3Schools**, **Udemy web app courses**, **YouTube**, and various **online forums** to guide me through the development of my webpage. Additionally, I referred to professional websites where I was able to:

- Create my own custom logo.
- Access professional headshots to enhance the overall design and presentation of the site.

## Authors Comments:
*This project was inspired after moving jobs and using recruitment websites daily. I found it irritating how a search would bring back jobs that had no relevance to my search. I also felt that applying for multiple jobs was not efficient as I couldn't track the status of my applications. This inspired me to create a platform with **real-time application status** updates.*

*This project has been extremely time-consuming. Although it may seem like a simple application in some eyes, I am so happy that the functions work. I am also extremely proud of myself on reflection, as two years ago even "Hello World" seemed complex. Go raibh maith agat as l√©amh.*
